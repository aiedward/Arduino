# Arduino
Real Time &amp; Embedded System - Arduino - Java - Python - IR Sensor - WebCam - FaceDetection

Thanks to OpenCV we can capture images in real time and process to check if there is any face, in positive case will try to recognize the face, If know the face turn on a green light and if is a unknow turn a light in red.

The idea is to know how work the arduino board, signals and data from sensors and to learn how to use the OpenCV library.
This implemention can use it for a security software(Turn on an alarm or save the image to later send them to the police in case of a unknow face) or for a Home Automation software(Turn on your favorite every time you enter in your house, open the windows, etc when there is a know faces)
